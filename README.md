# Lox-Implementation
This is my implementation of the Lox programming language, created by Robert Nystrom for his book Crafting Interpreters.

It is available for free online at: 
https://craftinginterpreters.com/

To build the C implementation on windows, I just used the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and used the makefiles provided in the [Crafting Interpreters repository](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters with only a couple minor changes.
